    <h1>This html page is connected to a Javascript page.</h1>
    <h2> General Methods to link a Javascript file to html page are:- </h2>
    <h3>1.Embedding code</h3>
    <h4>To add the JavaScript code into the HTML pages, we can use the script tag of the HTML that wrap around
        JavaScript code inside the HTML program. Users can also define JavaScript code in the

        <body> tag
            (or we can say body section) or

            <head> tag
                because it completely depends on the structure of the web page that the users use.
    </h4>
    <h3>2.Inline code</h3>
    <h4>Generally, this method is used when we have to call a function in the HTML event attributes.
        There are many cases (or events) in which we have to add JavaScript code directly.</h4>

    <h4>(In this page script tag is used to link a external JS file.)</h4>
    <script>
        console.log(x)
    </script>
    <script>
        console.log(y);
    </script>
</body>
